        <p className="mb-6">
          We provide a decentralized interface allowing users, through their
          self-custodial wallets, to interact with public blockchain protocols.
        </p>

        <h3 className="mt-8 mb-3 font-clash font-semibold text-xl md:text-2xl">
          User custody
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Users retain full control and custody over their virtual assets. It is
          important to understand that neither we nor any affiliated entity is a
          party to any transaction on the blockchain networks underlying the
          Protocol; we do not have possession, custody or control over any
          cryptoassets, or any user&apos;s funds. You understand that when you
          interact with the Protocol, you retain control over your virtual
          assets at all times.

        <p className="mb-4">
          Users use third-party self-custodial wallets to interact with the
          Protocol; we have no control or guarantee over the wallets. To
          interact with the Protocol using the Interface, you will need to
          connect and engage with it through your self-custodial wallet.
          It&apos;s essential to understand that your self-custodial wallet is
          provided by a third-party entity and is generally governed by separate
          terms and conditions set by the respective third-party service
          provider. These terms and conditions may involve additional fees,
          disclaimers, or risk warnings regarding the accuracy and reliance on
          the provided information.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Reviewing and comprehending the terms and conditions associated with
          your chosen self-custodial wallet provider to ensure compliance and to
          be aware of any applicable charges or risks is your sole
          responsibility.

          Non-custodial and decentralized
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Due to the non-custodial and decentralized nature of the technology,
          we are not intermediaries, agents, advisors, or custodians, and we do
          not have a fiduciary relationship or obligation to you regarding any
          decisions, actions, or transactions you make when using our Services.
          This includes, without limitation, any transactions you initiate with
          or through our Protocol or any other decentralized protocols,
          applications, or services accessible via the Services.

          Blockchain transparency
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We have no information about all Protocol transactions beyond what is
          publicly available via the blockchain. You acknowledge that we do not
          have information regarding all protocol transactions beyond what is
          available or obtainable publicly via the blockchain. However, we may
          collect information regarding the users of the Services in accordance
          with our Privacy Policy.

        <h3 className="mt-8 mb-3 font-clash font-semibold text-xl md:text-2xl">
          Service fees
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The protocol collects a 1/10 share of the yield accrued by the user.
          There are no upfront costs, and no fees on deposits or withdrawals. We
          aim to decrease the fee further as the protocol grows and generates
          more revenue to pay for blockchain network, infrastructure and
          operational costs.
        </p>

        <h3 className="mt-8 mb-3 font-clash font-semibold text-xl md:text-2xl">
          Network fees
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          There may be associated blockchain fees. Transactions conducted via
          blockchain networks may be subject to various fees imposed by third
          parties for access to and use of such permissionless networks. These
          fees may include, without limitation, gas fees, which are network
          transaction fees paid to validators, block producers, or similar
          participants for the processing, validation, and confirmation of
          transactions on the relevant blockchain network.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Additionally, certain decentralized protocols, applications, or
          third-party services that you access through the Services may impose
          separate fees, including but not limited to swap fees, liquidity
          provider fees, or fees associated with fiat on-ramp and off-ramp
          services. To the extent a counterparty is involved, such fees are
          determined, levied, and collected solely by the relevant third
          parties.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          You acknowledge and agree that certain blockchain network fees may be
          non-refundable in all circumstances, including but not limited to
          instances where a transaction is reverted, fails to execute, or is
          otherwise unsuccessful. You are solely responsible for understanding
          and bearing all costs, fees, and charges associated with your use of
          the Services, including those imposed by decentralized protocols,
          smart contracts, or third-party service providers. We make no
          representations, warranties, or guarantees as to the availability,
          accuracy, functionality, or suitability of any third-party services,
          fee structures, or transactions.

          Assumption of Risks
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You acknowledge that using the Services involves inherent risks,
          including but not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul className="mb-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
          <li>
            Market risk: Volatility in the price of digital assets may result in
            losses.
          </li>
          <li>
            Technology risk: Smart contracts may contain flaws, bugs, or
            vulnerabilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Liquidity risk: Assets may not always be immediately subject to
            withdraw.
          </li>
          <li>
            Counterparty risk: Interactions with other protocol users may

        <p className="mb-4">
          You further understand that digital asset markets are influenced by
          factors such as adoption, speculation, technological change,
          regulatory developments, and security incidents, all of which can lead
          to sudden and extreme fluctuations in value. Transaction costs and
          processing times on blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum) are also
          unpredictable and may increase sharply.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          By accessing the Services, you confirm that you have sufficient
          knowledge of blockchain technology and digital assets (including, but

          You acknowledge that technologies like smart contracts, cryptographic
          tokens, and related blockchain-based applications remain experimental,
          speculative, and subject to disruption. Issues such as bugs,
          cyberattacks, system failures, or blockchain reorganizations (e.g.,
          forks) could cause significant losses, including complete loss of
          assets. We disclaim any responsibility or liability for such risks. If
          you are not prepared to accept these risks, you should not use the
          Services.

          to the automated collection, processing, and distribution of digital
          assets in accordance with the applicable smart contract logic, which
          solely determines the transfer of funds and ownership of assets.

          Dispute Resolution

          Terms or the Services (each, a &quot;Dispute&quot;) through good faith
          discussions. At minimum, this process requires the party raising the
          Dispute to provide the other party with written notice describing the
          issue in detail. The recipient of the notice will have thirty (30)
          days to respond. Within sixty (60) days of the original notice, the
          parties must meet and confer in good faith, either by videoconference
          or telephone, in an effort to reach a resolution. If the Dispute has
          not been resolved within ninety (90) days of the initial notice, the
          parties may choose to mediate the matter, or else either party may
          proceed to arbitration as outlined below.

          If a Dispute cannot be resolved through the negotiation process

          accordance with the International Arbitration Rules of the
          International Centre for Dispute Resolution. The arbitration will take
          place in the Cayman Islands, and the proceedings will be conducted in
          English. The arbitrator(s) must have experience in matters involving
          internet technologies, software, financial transactions, and,
          preferably, blockchain systems. Any award of damages must be
          consistent with the &quot;Limitation of Liability&quot; section of
          these Terms, including restrictions on the types and amounts of
          damages available.

        <p className="mb-6">
          The prevailing party in any arbitration will be entitled to recover

          the existence, details, or outcome of any arbitration conducted under
